-- 1. Identify the top-selling [top 3] products in each category.

WITH TOP_PRODUCTS AS
(
SELECT p.category, p.product_id, p.product_name, SUM(s.total_sales) AS total_sales,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(s.total_sales) DESC) AS rank
FROM products as p
INNER JOIN sales as s
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY p.category, total_sales DESC
)
SELECT * 
FROM TOP_PRODUCTS
WHERE rank <= 3;



-- 2. Calculate the average revenue per store location.

SELECT st.country, st.city, ROUND(AVG(sl.total_sales)::numeric, 2) as Avg_revenue
FROM stores AS st
INNER JOIN sales AS sl
ON st.store_id = sl.store_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;



-- 3. Analyze seasonal sales trends across different regions. 

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT st.country, TO_CHAR(sl.sale_date, 'Month') AS Month, SUM(sl.total_sales) as total_sales
FROM sales AS sl
INNER JOIN stores AS st

GROUP BY 1, TO_CHAR(sl.sale_date, 'Month')
ORDER BY 1
)
SELECT * FROM CTE
ORDER BY country, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(Month, 'Mon'));



--4. Determine the profitability of each product category.

SELECT p.category, ROUND(SUM(s.total_sales::numeric - (s.quantity * p.cogs::numeric)), 2) as Profitability
FROM products AS p
INNER JOIN sales as s
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1

-- 5. Which products have not been sold at all?

SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN sales s
ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.product_id IS NULL;



-- 6. How are stores ranked based on their performance?

SELECT st.store_id, st.store_name, st.country, SUM(sl.total_sales) AS total_sales, 
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(sl.total_sales) DESC) AS Stores_rank
FROM sales sl
INNER JOIN stores st

from LAST_CTE AS l
LEFT JOIN CURRENT_CTE AS c
ON l.store_id = c.store_id
WHERE c.totals < l.totals
OR c.totals IS NULL;



-- 8. Calculate the profit margin percentage for each product.

SELECT s.product_id, 
ROUND(SUM((s.total_sales::numeric - (s.quantity * p.cogs::numeric))/NULLIF(s.total_sales::numeric, 0) * 100), 3) as profit_percentage
FROM sales AS s
INNER JOIN products p
ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY 1
order by 1;



-- 9. Evaluate yearly growth rate by revenue and profit of each countryâ€™s business

WITH CTE01 AS
(
SELECT st.country, 	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sl.sale_date) AS year, SUM(sl.total_sales) as total_sales,
SUM(sl.total_sales::numeric - (sl.quantity*p.cogs::numeric)) as total_profit
FROM SALES sl
INNER JOIN stores st   
ON sl.store_id = st.store_id
INNER JOIN products p
ON p.product_id = sl.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
),
CTE02 
AS(
SELECT country, year, total_sales AS current_year_sales,
LAG(total_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY year) as last_year_sales,
total_profit as current_year_profit,
LAG(total_profit) over(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY year) as last_year_profit
FROM CTE01
)
SELECT country, year, COALESCE(last_year_sales, 0) as last_year_sales, 
current_year_sales,
COALESCE(ROUND((current_year_sales::numeric - last_year_sales::numeric)/last_year_sales::numeric * 100, 3), 0) as sales_growth_ratio,
COALESCE(last_year_profit, 0) as last_year_profit,
current_year_profit, 
COALESCE(ROUND((current_year_profit - last_year_profit) / last_year_profit * 100, 3), 0) as profit_growth_ratio
FROM CTE02;



--10. Identify geographical regions with the highest sales growth rate.

WITH CTE1 AS
(
SELECT st.country, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sl.sale_date) AS year, SUM(total_sales) as totals
FROM sales sl
INNER JOIN stores st
ON sl.store_id = st.store_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
),
CTE2 AS
(
SELECT country, year, totals AS current_year_sales, 
LAG(totals) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY year) as last_year_sales
FROM CTE1
)
SELECT country, 
COALESCE(ROUND(SUM((current_year_sales::numeric - last_year_sales::numeric)/NULLIF(last_year_sales::numeric,0) * 100), 3), 0) AS Sales_growth_rate
FROM CTE2
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
